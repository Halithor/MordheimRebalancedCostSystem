# The Marquart Mordheim Cost System

This is a cost calculating system for the Mordheim. When we sat down and started playing Mordheim, we realized many warband model costs are unbalanced. *This is not a rework of the Mordheim Rules.* The system described here is a framework to price units fairly based on maximum attributes, starting attributes, special rules, and starting experience. Play with the normal Mordheim rules. We hope to create a more balanced experience using this cost system.

This system can be applied to standard warbands and homebrew alike. Changing the cost of models in current warbands will place them into a standardized system. Giving some level of assurance that the scenario will be balanced.

Following this system, you can throw together your own homebrew warband relatively quickly, while having confidence that it is balanced against other warbands using this system.


## Getting Started

If you're here looking for the standard rulebooks, but with a more balanced unit costs, check out the [Warbands directory](warbands/). Inside, you'll find a number of warbands that we've already rebalanced. If you don't find your desired warband within that directory, consider doing the calculations for your warband and contributing the rebalanced rules to this repository.

If you're interested in the system, start in the [System Basics](SystemBasics.md) file. Inside you will find an overview of how the system works and the tables corresponding to the point values of different unit attribute changes. The details of the costs of special rules can be found in the [Special Rules](SpecialRules.md) document.

If any information is missing from these documents, please consider contributing to this project!

## Contributing

Anyone interested in contributing should open a pull request with the changes you'd like to see. Any additional remakes of well known warbands will be reviewed for balanced and accepted. Homebrew warbands won't be accepted into this repository, but please open a pull request to add a link to your warband. Changes to the system overall will require additional discussion, along with play testing.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to the Mordheim team for making an awesome game. The original content that makes up the warbands is not created by me, but the rebalance of the costs of the content is my work.
