# Wood Elf Warbands - The Asrai Wayfarers
Version 1.0 \
Reworked by Sam & Jake Marquart 

This is a rework of the Wood Elf Warband rules made by Davin "GhostElf" Madden, Jared "Abused Toyz" Schmidt, and the Mordheimer. This rework was done to rebalance the cost and attributes of the Wood Elves. This is in an effort to make a more unified Mordheim system. The costs of these models is based on a standard system.

** NOTE THIS IS UNFINISHED **

## Lore

Nobody really knows why the Wood Elves left Athel Loren to hunt down Wyrdstones. But here they are!

## Choice of Warriors

A Wood Elf Warband has 500 gold crowns to spend on their initial models and equipment. The warband must have a minimum of 3 warriors in it, and can never have more than 12 warriors.

## Special Rules

**Forest Walk**

Wood Elves move through forest and wood terrain without penalty.

**Excellent Sight**

Wood elves are cunning and elusive. They may spot hidden enemies from two times as far away as other warriors (i.e. twice their initiative in inches).

**Subtle Nature**

Wood elves will never use any black powder weapons and cannot wear any heavy armor, except Ithilmar Armor.

**Clandestine**

Wood elves are secretive, therefore they will never hire any Hired Swords or Dramatis Personae that are not elven.

**Elven Weaponsmiths**

Wood Elves have access to secret markets to find equipment made by elves. Elven bows have a -2 for rarity when purchased from the store.

## Wood Elves Maximum Profile

## Wood Elf Special Skills

A Wood Elf hero may identify himself with a particular animal, and thus gain some of their characteristics. This is known as gaining an Animal Aspect. Heroes may only have one Aspect, and there can never be more than one hero with the same aspect in a Warband.

### Aspect of the Hawk

This skill can only be taken by a model with _Quickshot_. The model may then use the _Quickshot_ two shots per turn and can ignore all To-Hit penalties for moving.

### Aspect of the Panther

If hidden, a warrior with this skill may shoot missile weapons and remain hidden. If the target of the attack is not stunned or put out of action as a result of this attack, it can take an initiative test; if the test is passed, the target sees the attacker who is no longer considered hidden.

### Aspect of the Fox

A wood elf with this skill is always placed on the battlefield after the opposing Warband and can be placed anywhere on the table as long as it is out of sight of the opposing Warband and more than 12" away from any enemy model. If both players have models with this skill or _Infiltrate_, roll a D6 for each, and lowest sets up first.

### Aspect of the Rabbit

A model with this skill can avoid melee or missile attacks on a roll of 6. If the model also has _Step Aside_ or _Dodge_ skills, this will increase the roll to a 4+ in the relevant area. For example, a wood elf with Rabbit Aspect and _Step Aside_ avoids melee attacks on a 4+ and missile attacks on a 6.

## Fey Magic List

The Wood Elves protection comes from an entirely different source, that of the forest of Athel Loren: the forests natural web of consciousness forms both conduit and shield to the Elven mages who would draw upon this potent force.

1.  **Angering Spites –** The wizard summons an anger of spites that appear as a glowing red orb. This spell has a range of 18" and causes one S4 hit to the first model in its path. Armor saves are allowed as normal. \
**Difficulty:** 7

2. **Oakskin –** The wizard&#39;s skin takes on the appearance of rigid. This spell gives the wizard a 2+ armor save which replaces any other armor save. \
**Difficulty:** 7

3. **Terrifying Spites –** The wizard summons up serveral wailing and horrifying spites. Choose a friendly model within 8" (including the wizard himself). That model causes _Fear_ for the rest of the battle. This spell may only successfully be cast once per battle. \
**Difficulty:** 9

4. **Fury of the Wild -**  The wizard calls the primal fury of the forest into his body. The wizard gets +1 movement, +1 attack, +2 strength, and + 1 weapon skill. The wizard must take a leadership test at the beginning of each of the wizard&#39;s own turns to maintain; if the test fails, the spell ends. \
**Difficulty:** 8

5. **Ever-Living Resplendence –** The wizard summons a powerful force of healing spirits. Any individual model within 4" of the wizard (including himself) may be healed. The warrior is restored to his full quota of wounds. This spell may also be used if any friendly model within 4" is stunned or knocked down, they immediately come to their senses, stand up, and continue fighting as normal.\
**Difficulty:** 6

6. **Call of the Hunt –** The spellwalker calls forth a ghostly requiem of sounds and voices of the magnificent hunt, filling his allies with hunting fervor. One friendly model within 8" of the caster gains +1 To-Hit and +1 To-Injure rolls in the next turn of shooting and close combat.\
**Difficulty:** 9
